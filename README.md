# [My portfolio](https://daniildavtian.vercel.app/)
This is my first portfolio! <br> 
I tried to make it minimal and aesthetic. <br>
It has dark/light mode switch that automaticly changes color sheme depending on user's device theme and saves chosen theme in local storage. <br>

TODO:
- [x] Better hover animations
- [x] ~~Maybe paralax effect~~
- [x] Maybe blured blub following the mouse
- [ ] Separate page for each project
